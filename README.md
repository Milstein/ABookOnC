ABookOnC
========

I intended to start this two summers ago, but winter break afforded me this opportunity to brush up on C. I'm working through "A Book on C by Al Kelley and Ira Pohl" (ISBN: 978-0-201-18399-3). 

My goal is to finish by January 28th, when the next semester begins for me at Brooklyn College. I'll have to do between 30-35 pages every day to finish on the 27th. 

Given that I'm also trying to read two other similarly sized books by then, I don't know how successful I'll be, but here's to another adventure.

January 5, 2015 (Day 1, 29 pages)

I've worked through the first 29 pages of the book, until unit 1.7. Covered so far: variables, data types, format characters, control structures.
