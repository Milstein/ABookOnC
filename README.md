ABookOnC
========

I intended to start this two summers ago, but winter break afforded me this opportunity to brush up on C. I'm working through "A Book on C by Al Kelley and Ira Pohl" (ISBN: 978-0-201-18399-3). 

My goal is to finish by January 28th, when the next semester begins for me at Brooklyn College. I'll have to do between 30-35 pages every day to finish on the 27th. Given that I'm also trying to read two other similarly sized books by then, I don't know how successful I'll be, but here's to another adventure.

**29 pages, about an hour** I've worked through the first 29 pages of the book, until unit 1.7. Covered so far: variables, data types, format characters, control structures. I knew a lot of this material already, but I learned two cool string formats. The `%e` format is scientific notation, and the `%g` format chooses the shorter version from scientific or decimal notation.

**13 pages, 45 minutes** I covered only half of my goal today because I started at midnight. Tomorrow I have to do 45 pages to stay on track. Tonight covered: functions, strings, and arrays. Bubble sort, and  getchar and putchar made cameos. Up next are pointers and file I/O.
